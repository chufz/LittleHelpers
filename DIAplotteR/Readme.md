# DIAplotteR

This repository contains code for visualizing MS2 fragments in a chromatogram. MS2 aquisition is perforemd in data independent aquisition mode, where the mzml contains several channels of a spezific precursor range, which is specified in the DIA_info.csv.

A further fragment list defines the fragments, which should be plotted. An iteration parameter defines which column should be plotted. Further parallelisation of the plotting for large lists can be performed in bash running the skript with different iteration parameters.
