# QAQC skirpts

These skripts are based on the R package peakpantheR (DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btab433) to check the Quality of a MS run, also during analysis.
It is recommended to make them as R-executable files on a Windows machine, to enjoy the one-click performance:)

How to make R files executable under windows, see http://www.r-datacollection.com/blog/making-r-files-executable/
